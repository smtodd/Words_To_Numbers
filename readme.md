This Python function converts words written in text into digits.  It uses the three digit groups and English naming conventions most common in the USA.  It is still a work in progress. Right now, it can only handle a few numbers and written text that consists of a single digit group (eg. "one million").  It cannot yet handle strings with more than one three digit group (eg. "one million one thousand")  It is a beginner project for me to learn Python for data science.
